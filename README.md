# Deathtrap

I wanted to make a robot.
It's an angled spinner which means it's not very effective, but I don't care.
Modeled on tinkercad, printed on an Ender 3.
The current model is here https://www.tinkercad.com/things/5qX1Q9WO0Pc-death-trap-v4-wip

I own rights to the logo, so please don't reuse it.
